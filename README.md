# TE-2-4--Counter-Module

A counter is a very handy piece of equipment. It can be used as test equipment, for display, or for experimentation. Our versatile counter module is especially useful. Many variations and adaptions can be engineered around it, as it is a basic building block. It can be used to count from one cycle per hour to nearly 3MHz. To cater for frequencies higher than 3MHz, additional dividing networks can be included at the front end. This would extend the frequency 100 times or more.

Our project will accept 6 different sensors; light, sound, magnetic, unit, oscillator, and infra-red. Actually the counter module is quite an easy project. Most of the complexity is contained within the two chips and only a few outside components such as resistors need be added. These resistors interface (connect between) the counting chip and the display. They provide current limiting for the display segments and driver transistors. The four resistors at the input of the IC provide pull-up and pull-down. This sets the condition HIGH or LOW on the inputs as many have a dual role. At first glance this project may seem expensive compared to a pocket calculator. Some calculators have unit-count facilities incorporated into the plus key and this can be extended externally to an oscillator or reed switch sensor. But a Calculator project doesn't give any constructional experience or enable you to add your own read-out. diagram. Nor does it allow you to add your own read-out. Any of the six sensors can be fed into the 74C926. These will be the basis of the second part of this project. Consider this project as a paying proposition. You have been requested by an engineering firm to design a simple parts counter to tally daily production. Of course it is always possible to bulk-weigh components on a set of ratio-scales, but the management has stipulated an optical counter situated near the operator. You will be required to build a working proto-type for a four week trial-run. How do you think you will fair? The only catch is, you will have to wait for the next issue for the optical sensor. Any manufacturing firm producing a number of similar items such as plastic parts, packaging of small items, adding a label to a bottle or hand preparing or de-burring will find a unit-counting recorder of immense benefit. The main advantage of an electronic counter is the number of sensors it will accept. It's a very simple task to adapt optical, magnetic, or audio sensors to count production parts. And most importantly, it is the simplicity of set-up which will appeal to the operator.
